# Ad-Click-Prediction
Creating a model in R that predicts which individuals are most likely to click on Ads


###################################### 1. Defining the Question

```## A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. My task as a Data Science Consultant is to to help her by creating a model that predicts which individuals are most likely to click on her ads ```

###################################### 2. Metrics for Success

  ```##                               1. An Accuracy Score of atleast 85%
                                      2. A low RMSE Score
                                      3. Confusion Matrix with more correct predictions than incorrect ones
```

###################################### 3. Understanding the Context

```## It is imperative that all entrepreneurs identify all opportunities to advertise and boost their sales in whatever business they are engaged in. More over, online advertisements are a key driver of sales of products and services and its important for entrepreneurs to capitalise on this by identifying peak hours for ads to be clicked, the type of ads that people like, personality traits of site visitors and other demographics of potential clients such as age, employment status, interests, hobbies, career etc. Knowing such information creates an avenue for channeling the right adverts to potential clients and classifying or predicting whether or not they'll click on the ad.
